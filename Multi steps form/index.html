                245 11. PROPERTY MAINTENANCE: Except for ordinary wear and tear and Casualty Loss, Seller shall maintain the
                246 247
                Property, including, but not limited to, lawn, shrubbery, and pool, in the condition existing as of Effective Date ("AS IS Maintenance Requirement").

                PROPERTY INSPECTIONS AND RIGHT TO CANCEL: Buyer shall have ______ (if left blank, then 15) days after Effective Date ("Inspection Period") within which to have such inspections of the Property performed as Buyer shall desire during the Inspection Period. If Buyer determines, in Buyer's sole discretion, that the Property is not acceptable to Buyer, Buyer may terminate this Contract by delivering written notice of such election to Seller prior to expiration of Inspection Period. If Buyer timely terminates this Contract, the Deposit paid shall be returned to Buyer, thereupon, Buyer and Seller shall be released of all further obligations under this Contract; however, Buyer shall be responsible for prompt payment for such inspections, for repair of damage to, and restoration of, the Property resulting from such inspections, and shall provide Seller with paid receipts for all work done on the Property (the preceding provision shall survive termination of this Contract). Unless Buyer exercises the right to terminate granted herein, Buyer accepts the physical condition of the Property and any violation of governmental, building, environmental, and safety codes, restrictions, or requirements, but subject to Seller's continuing AS IS Maintenance Requirement, and Buyer shall be responsible for any and all repairs and improvements required by Buyer's lender.
                WALK-THROUGH INSPECTION/RE-INSPECTION: On the day prior to Closing Date, or on Closing Date prior to time of Closing, as specified by Buyer, Buyer or Buyer's representative may perform a walk-through (and follow-up walk-through, if necessary) inspection of the Property solely to confirm that all items of Personal Property are on the Property and to verify that Seller has maintained the Property as required by the AS IS Maintenance Requirement and has met all other contractual obligations.
                SELLER ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION IN CLOSE-OUT OF BUILDING PERMITS: If Buyer's inspection of the Property identifies open or needed building permits, then Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer all plans, written documentation or other information in Seller's possession, knowledge, or control relating to improvements to the Property which are the subject of such open or needed Permits, and shall promptly cooperate in good faith with Buyer's efforts to obtain estimates of repairs or other work necessary to resolve such Permit issues. Seller's obligation to cooperate shall include Seller's execution of necessary authorizations,
